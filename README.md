# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/NSCC-SRM/recruitment24.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```

```

3. Install the necessary packages:

4. Run the development server:
